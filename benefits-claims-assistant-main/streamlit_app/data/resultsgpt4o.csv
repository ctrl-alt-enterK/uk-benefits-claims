"Delays in claim resolution under the NHS guidelines might be caused by several factors:

1. **Missed Limitation Periods**: If the limitation period is missed, the claim may become time-barred, meaning you could lose the right to seek compensation. This delay might occur if the claimant does not seek legal advice early.
  
2. **Different Limitation Periods**: Different types of claims have different limitation periods. If a claimant or their legal adviser is unaware of the specific limitation period applicable to their type of claim, this could result in delays or even a missed deadline, complicating the resolution process.

Evidence must show that the harm was a direct consequence of the breach and could have been prevented with appropriate care.",Expert testimony helps clarify the connection between the breach of duty and the resulting harm especially in medically complex cases.,cc43bb7a-c97c-598d-8ebb-7f6b7d127c02,How is the link between breach of duty and harm established in complex cases?,nhs claim benefits

3. **Avoidability of Harm**: Expert witnesses are needed to elucidate whether the harm could have been avoided if the duty had not been breached.
   
4. **Establishing Direct Links**: Evidence such as medical records combined with expert testimony is necessary to show a direct link between the breach of duty and the harm caused.

While time delays can complicate this process, causation can still be proven if the delay directly worsened the condition.",Time delays can complicate proving causation but if the delay directly worsened the condition causation can be established.,8dcad343-9e31-525e-a64b-aed0827a4372,Can a long delay in medical treatment impact the establishment of causation?,nhs claim benefits
"Time delays can make it more challenging to prove causation in negligence claims. However, if it can be demonstrated that the delay directly worsened the patient’s condition, causation can be established. Essentially, it needs to be shown that the harm experienced by the patient would have been avoided with timely treatment or diagnosis.",Time delays can complicate proving causation but if the delay directly worsened the condition causation can be established.,8dcad343-9e31-525e-a64b-aed0827a4372,What impact does a time delay have on proving that negligence caused harm?,nhs claim benefits
"Time delays can affect the outcome of a negligence claim by complicating the process of proving causation. For causation to be established, it must be shown that the delay directly worsened the condition. If the claimant can demonstrate that timely treatment would have prevented the harm, then causation can still be proven despite the delay. However, as time progresses, accumulating evidence that directly links the delay to the worsened condition can become more challenging.

Proving causation in cases involving delayed treatment specifically requires demonstrating that the delay resulted in harm that would have been avoided with timely intervention. Therefore, the impact of time delays largely depends on the ability to substantiate these claims with clear evidence.",Time delays can complicate proving causation but if the delay directly worsened the condition causation can be established.,8dcad343-9e31-525e-a64b-aed0827a4372,How can time delays affect the outcome of a negligence claim?,nhs claim benefits
